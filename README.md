# ROS-Navigation
 Navigation is one of the most essential tools in ROS. It allows mobile robots to move around autonomously. This is used in many robotics fields: logistic robots for warehouses, domestic robots that perform certain household tasks, entertainment robots, etc

 1. Setup ROS Navigation Stack on a Robot
 2. Building a map of the environment from zero
 3. Perform Robot Localization
 4. Autonomous Path Planning
 5. Understanding Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
 6. Obstacle Avoidance
